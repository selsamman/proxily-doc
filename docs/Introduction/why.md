title: Why Proxily?
id: how
---
Redux, Redux-toolkit, MobX and MobX-state-tree are all very effective mechanisms for managing state changes in complex applications. There are also a number of newer state management libraries such as Recoil, Hook State and Akita and many more. There are also fully proxy-based state management systems such as Valtio and React-easy-state.

The goal of Proxily is simple: **Provide all features in Redux without being prescriptive**
 
We believe we have come very close to that goal and hope you enjoy:

* the simplicity of mutable state,
* having simple and straight-forward state definitions,
* using the accessory features Redux users have come to rely on,
* exploring unique features such as Transactions with undo/redo commit/rollback.

The author, Sam Elsamman has written other frameworks, such as [Amorphic](https://medium.com/haven-life/an-introduction-to-the-isomorphic-paradigm-using-amorphic-b7a8071ca11f), and [redux-capi](https://selsamman.github.io/redux-capi/docs/intro), a redux-based state management library for react. Sam's state management frameworks are in use in applications such as [Gymanize](https://gymanize.com/) and [Cdash19](https://cdash19.com/)
